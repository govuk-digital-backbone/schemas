# schema.gov.uk â€“ UK Government Open Schema Repository

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a proposed platform for managing schemas. The schemas in this repository are **not** to be used for production systems or services. They are currently very work in progress and will change without notice.

This repository contains open, machine-readable schemas published under the `https://schema.gov.uk/` namespace.

The purpose of this repo is to provide a common, interoperable way to represent assurance frameworks, guidance, and related information so that organisations in government, the public sector, and the private sector can build tools and services that speak the same language.

## Where are the schemas used?

- A primary use case is with the (equally very work in progress) `entity.gov.uk` service, which provides a common way to represent entities (such as organisations, services, professions, and functions) across the UK public sector.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions about the structure, purpose and usage of this service and repository. If you have suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or use [discussons](https://github.com/orgs/govuk-digital-backbone/discussions).

In future, we will also welcome contributions of schemas themselves. If you have ideas about a schema and use cases for it, please open an issue or use discussions to share your ideas.
